    Description:
        This is the main module to the OORMS Lab 3 assignment from the EEE320 Object Oriented Analysis class.
        Running this module will cause a window to appear. Said window simulates people seated at given chairs around a
        table placing orders.

    Task:
        To implement all the sequence diagrams outlined in the lab instructions into the code.
        Testing code has been provided for us.


    Lab Started: September 19, 2022
    Lab Members: OCdt Al-Ansar Mohammed, OCdt Liethan Velasco.


    Notes:

          1 - Velasco: I see when creating an object from a class that inherits from another class,
          if you don't give it its own "overloaded" constructor, it automatically inherits the
          constructor from its parent (duh yea why did I have to mention that). When you do write
          an overloaded constructor though, you have to call the parents constructor with super().__init__(),
          or the console gets mad.

          2 - Velasco: I've asked the prof as to why we have a function definition embedded within the code of a method,
          and the reason for this one specifically is that each table/chair will get its very own handler function.
          I'm guessing because its literally defined and called whenever the create_restaurant_ui() and
          create_seat_ui() methods are called, the function handler for each of the tables/chairs are created right
          then and there, and subsequently used whether the user touches one of the tables/chairs. I'm also presuming
          this function definition needs to be made here in order to use the tag_bind() event binding function provided
          by tkinter right after, as I see a reference to the handler function gets passed this tag_bind() function.
          FurthermoreI'm going to look more into the tkinter documentation for this to see what exactly
          is going on behind the scenes.
          OOHHH I think I see why the reference to the function handlers defined in the methods gets passed through
          the tag_bind() methods xD it's done so that the tkinter program knows what function to call (or simply code
          to run) in the event that an event (a click in this case) is detected. Silly me.

          Just to remember, a handler in programming was defined like this online:
            "...an event handler is a callback routine that operates asynchronously once an event takes place.
            It dictates the action that follows the event. The programmer writes a code for this action to take place."

          Right, so I'm guessing the reason why the code was structured to have a function definition of the handler
          within the method is to ensure that each table/chair object legit got its own specific handler, for
          each and every single object that appears on the screen, whenever their specific interfaces show up.

          Eh, sorry if you've actually read this whole thing doctor xD. I normally write stuff like this to get all
          my thoughts out and try to understand something, while recording it at the same time you know. I tend to
          be rather verbose and repetitive doing it.

          AH I found it (I think)! The tag_bind() function essentially acts as a decorator/wrapper function to our
          function handler, and for this to be possible the function handler needs to passed in through tag_bind()'s
          arguments. There, that should be the case.
