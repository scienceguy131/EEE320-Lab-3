""" This is essentially the main module of the Lab 3 OORMS program.


    Task: To implement all the sequence diagrams outlined in the lab instructions
    into the code. Testing code has been provided for us.


    Lab Started: September 19, 2022
    Lab Members: OCdt Al-Ansar Mohammed, OCdt Liethan Velasco.



    Notes:
          - Velasco: I see when creating an object from a class that inherits from another class,
          if you don't give it its own "overloaded" constructor, it automatically inherits the
          constructor from its parent (duh yea why did I have to mention that). When you do write
          an overloaded constructor though, you have to call the parents constructor with super().__init__(),
          or the console gets mad.


    Status:
        - Velasco (Sept 19, 2022) COMPLETED: Reading code for the first time to see what we've got to work with.
        Adding inline comments to organize things. These can be deleted later.
        - Velasco and Mohammed (Sept 20, 2022) COMPLETED: Implementing the Table Touch sequence diagram.
        - Mohammed (Sept 20, 2022) finished last sequence diagram (cancelling) and tested UI and ran tests.py
        sucessfully
